abstract: >-
  PDBRust is a fast Rust library for parsing and analyzing
  Protein Data Bank (PDB) and mmCIF protein structure files.
  It provides comprehensive support for molecular structure
  data with robust error handling, structural analysis,
  quality assessment, and RCSB PDB integration. Also
  available as a Python package with 40-260x speedups over
  pure Python implementations.
